# CUDAFindGCF

Created for research project at Brookhaven National Laboratory, Summer 2016. 

Attempts to brute-force patterns in the continued fraction representations of the non-trivial Riemann Zeta zeroes. Uses CUDA to do this on hundreds of possible matches at once.

The Bignum library, ttmath, was made by Tomasz Sowa. It can be found at http://www.ttmath.org/.
